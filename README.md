I used a machine VM which I had restricted access and Installed minikube,K8s and ArgoCD. 
Created K8s Objects.
Created a Github Action workflow but it is just a code template for deploying the hello-world version.
ArgoCD template is present which will detect change in the Git URL and apply the change in Cluster.
